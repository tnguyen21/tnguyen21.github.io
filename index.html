		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>I am a computer scientist, writer, and book lover bouncing homebody-ing in Chicago. Currently, I am pursuing a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics at <a href="https://drexel.edu/cci/">Drexel University</a>. Previously, I have worked at <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/home">Vanguard</a> as an IT Developer Intern and assistant researcher in the <a href="https://research.coe.drexel.edu/ece/dwsl/">Drexel Wireless Systems Laboratory</a>. I have also worked as a web developer for <a href="https://risefirst.org/">Rise First</a>.</p>

		<p>At the moment, I am a full time student doing some web development and web design on the side for the <a href="https://sase-drexel.weebly.com/">Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers (SASE) Drexel Chapter</a>. This coming fall, I will be a Software Engineer with <a href="https://www.sharingexcess.com/">Sharing Excess</a>.

		<p>Looking towards the future, I'd like to broaden my skillset and become a full-stack developer with some specialized knowledge in high level statistics and machine learning. I see myself working on projects that serve a greater social good, and innovating fields that have historically been overlooked by individuals currently working in tech.</p>

		<p>In my free time I like to read speculative fiction, tech, culture, history, and politics. I like to consider myself aggressively curious and like to pick up new hobbies and skills when I can. Every so often I'll also find time to write. I maintain a small <a href="https://overthinking.substack.com/">newsletter</a> where I talk about the things I'm reading.</p>
